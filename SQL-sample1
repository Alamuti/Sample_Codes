-- Description  : The query collects the IPs linked to the notices sent out by FMTS for the past week. Then, the results are compared against similar incidents in the past year. If same IPs are found linked to the                        same hosting provider, that ASN is marked â€˜as failed to comply for removing that IP. Only ISP Notices are considered.
